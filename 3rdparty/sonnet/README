Sonnet is provided by KDE under LGPL license, which AFAIK is compatible
with GPLv3 (the license in which we are making Scrite available). LGPL
requires us to provide a way for users to relink a different version of
Sonnet with Scrite (as long as the code is compatible.) Since we have
provided the entire source code of Scrite under GPLv3, relinking is 
obviously possible.

The complete copyright of everything within the sonnet folder belongs
to its respective owners as clearly stated in the header of each of those
files.

We use Sonnet for its ability to provide fast spell-checking and 
highlighting capability. We cannot use Sonnet directly in our code
without changes, because we want to avoid external dependencies as much
as possible. We cannot expect developers who pull a copy of Scrite
from Git to compile Hunspell from source along with all its dependencies 
before compiling Scrite. We want them to simply be able to pull a copy 
of Scrite, load it in Qt Creator and build. Thats it.

The changes we have made to Sonnet source code is towards making this
happen. Plugins that we have added to Sonnet are in the plugins folder
within this directory. The plugins that come bundled with Sonnet are 
inside sonnet/src/plugins folder, from which we are only using 
nsspellchecker plugin (on macOS). 

If you have any questions regarding our use of Sonnet within Scrite
please write to us at scrite@teriflix.com.

IMPORTANT
===============

To build Scrite with Hunspell support on Linux, please install hunspell-dev
On Ubuntu, you can do this by executing the following command

sudo apt-get install libhunspell-dev

Depending on the version number of hunspell installed on your computer, you
will have to update config-hunspell.h. Comments in this file should help you
understand what changes you should be making.
