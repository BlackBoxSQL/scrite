## Create Your First Scene

To create your first scene, you can just click on the + icon in the page area.

The text you notice in the screenshot above is formatted as [Action](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/what-is-a-screenplay-formatting-tips-and-tricks#how-to-format-a-screenplay-step-2-action).

Lets say you want to now include a dialog between Sandra and Will. Just start a new paragraph by hitting the Enter (or Return) key on your keyboard. 

Notice the toolbar on the top?
